            "alt": "'A Chorus Line' is a stunning musical-vérité about a chorus audition for a Broadway musical. 

Set on the bare stage of a theatre during an audition, it is based on seventeen Broadway dancers auditioning for parts in the chorus. It tells of the achingly poignant ambitions of the performers and provides a glimpse into their personalities as they describe the events that have shaped their lives. It is renowned as a powerful metaphor for all human aspiration.

'A Chorus Line' won 9 Tony Awards out of 12 nominations including Best Musical, Best Original Score and Best Choreography
